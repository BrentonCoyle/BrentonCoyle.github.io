    </div>

    <div id="All" style="align-self: center;">
        <div id="Games">
           <p id="PText"> Hello there! I'm someone who thrives in the great outdoors, is passionate about creating games, and has a deep love for art. If you were to meet me in a new setting, you might think I'm a little reserved, but don't let that initial shyness fool you! Once you get to know me, you'll discover a vibrant and fun-loving person.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Games">
            <h1>Outdoor Enthusiast</h1>
            <p id="PText"> Nature is my playground. Whether it's hiking through the forest, camping under the stars, or simply taking a leisurely stroll through the park, I find solace and joy in the beauty of the natural world. The outdoors is where I recharge and find inspiration.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Games">
            <h1>Game Creator</h1>
            <p id="PText">My love for creativity extends to the digital realm. I enjoy designing and developing games, whether it's crafting intricate virtual worlds or devising fun, interactive board games. There's nothing quite like the feeling of seeing people enjoy something you've created.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Games">
            <h1>Artist</h1>
            <p id="PText">Art is my sanctuary. I find immense joy in expressing myself through various forms of art, from painting and drawing to digital design. It's a way for me to capture the beauty I see in the world and share it with others.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Games">
            <h1> Introvert</h1>
            <p id="PText"> I'll admit, I'm a bit of an introvert, especially when I'm in new situations. You might find me observing from the sidelines, taking it all in. But give me some time, and you'll see that I'm a genuinely warm and welcoming person once I feel comfortable.</p>
