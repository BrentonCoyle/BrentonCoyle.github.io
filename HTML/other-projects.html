            <p id="PText">Bad Beats is a game that a old school member said I should make. Its a boss fighting game simaler to Cuphead but its instrument themed. For the first boss you play as a Trumpet and fight a Drum, then you play as a Drum fighting a Tuba, finaly a Tuba fighting a Clarinet. The fights will have very fun bouncy music based around the boss/player. But I suck at creating music so I put the game on the bench while I learn how too.</p>

            <p id="PText">This game I made started as a joke amoung my friends. When I first made Tree Simulator in high school we made a list of tree-related games with a over all storyline spaning across 10 games that all have a diffrent style. It wass called the Tree Saga. This game takes place after Tree Simulator and trees have evolved and can grow very quickly, your job is to cut down the trees as they grow farster and faster, its kinda like a idle fighter. </p>
